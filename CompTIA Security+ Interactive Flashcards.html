                    options: ["A. DDoS", "B. Phishing", "C. SQL Injection", "D. Zero-day"],
                    answer: 1,
                    explanation: "Phishing is a social engineering technique where attackers send fraudulent messages designed to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information. DDoS is a network attack, SQL Injection is an application attack, and Zero-day refers to a vulnerability unknown to the vendor."
                },
                {
                    question: "What type of malware encrypts files and demands payment for decryption?",

                    answer: 1,
                    explanation: "Ransomware is a type of malicious software that encrypts files on a victim's system and demands payment (ransom) for the decryption key. Trojans disguise themselves as legitimate software, spyware collects information without consent, and adware displays unwanted advertisements."
                },
                {
                    question: "Which protocol provides encryption for secure web browsing?",
                    options: ["A. FTP", "B. HTTP", "C. HTTPS", "D. SMTP"],
                    answer: 2,
                    explanation: "HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) provides encrypted communication and secure identification of a network web server. HTTP is unencrypted, FTP is for file transfer, and SMTP is for email transmission."
                },
                {
                    question: "What does CIA stand for in cybersecurity?",
                    options: ["A. Central Intelligence Agency", "B. Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability", "C. Cyber Incident Assessment", "D. Critical Infrastructure Assurance"],
                    answer: 1,
                    explanation: "In cybersecurity, CIA stands for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability - the three core principles of information security. Confidentiality protects data from unauthorized access, Integrity ensures data is accurate and untampered, and Availability ensures systems are accessible when needed."
                },

                    answer: 2,
                    explanation: "Biometrics authentication uses unique physical characteristics such as fingerprints, facial recognition, or iris scans. Passwords and PINs are knowledge-based factors, while security tokens are possession-based factors."
                },
                {
                    question: "What is the primary purpose of a firewall?",
                    options: ["A. Virus detection", "B. Network traffic control", "C. Data encryption", "D. User authentication"],
                    answer: 1,
                    explanation: "A firewall's primary purpose is to control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. While some firewalls may have additional features, their core function is traffic control, not virus detection, encryption, or authentication."
                },
                {
                    question: "Which type of attack involves overwhelming a system with traffic?",
                    options: ["A. Phishing", "B. DoS", "C. Brute force", "D. Man-in-the-middle"],
                    answer: 1,
                    explanation: "A Denial of Service (DoS) attack aims to make a machine or network resource unavailable by overwhelming it with traffic. Phishing is social engineering, brute force attempts to crack credentials, and man-in-the-middle intercepts communications."
                },
                {
                    question: "What is multi-factor authentication?",
                    options: ["A. Using multiple passwords", "B. Verifying identity with multiple methods", "C. Having multiple user accounts", "D. Using multiple firewalls"],
                    answer: 1,
                    explanation: "Multi-factor authentication (MFA) requires users to provide two or more verification factors to gain access to a resource. These factors typically include something you know (password), something you have (token), and something you are (biometric)."
                },
                {
                    question: "Which port is typically used for SSH?",
                    options: ["A. 21", "B. 22", "C. 23", "D. 25"],
                    answer: 1,
                    explanation: "SSH (Secure Shell) uses port 22 by default. Port 21 is for FTP, port 23 is for Telnet, and port 25 is for SMTP."
                },
                {
                    question: "What does VPN stand for?",
                    options: ["A. Virtual Private Network", "B. Verified Public Network", "C. Virtual Public Network", "D. Verified Private Network"],
                    answer: 0,
                    explanation: "VPN stands for Virtual Private Network. It extends a private network across a public network, enabling users to send and receive data as if their devices were directly connected to the private network."
                },
                {
                    question: "Which of these is a symmetric encryption algorithm?",
                    options: ["A. RSA", "B. AES", "C. ECC", "D. Diffie-Hellman"],
                    answer: 1,
                    explanation: "AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is a symmetric encryption algorithm, meaning the same key is used for both encryption and decryption. RSA, ECC, and Diffie-Hellman are asymmetric algorithms that use public/private key pairs."

                    answer: 1,
                    explanation: "Hashing creates a fixed-size string of characters (hash) from input data of any size. It's primarily used to verify data integrity, as any change to the input will produce a different hash. Unlike encryption, hashing is a one-way process."

                    question: "Which provides secure file deletion?",
                    options: ["A. Moving to recycle bin", "B. Quick format", "C. Secure erase", "D. Defragmentation"],
                    answer: 2,
                    explanation: "Secure erase methods overwrite data multiple times with patterns to ensure it cannot be recovered. Moving to recycle bin doesn't delete files, quick format doesn't securely erase data, and defragmentation reorganizes files on disk."

                    answer: 1,
                    explanation: "The primary purpose of incident response is to handle security breaches effectively by containing the damage, eradicating the threat, and recovering systems. While prevention is ideal, the focus is on minimizing impact when incidents occur."

                    answer: 0,
                    explanation: "Input validation is a critical secure coding practice that ensures only properly formatted data enters a system, preventing many injection attacks. Hardcoded credentials, silent errors, and deprecated functions introduce security risks."

                    answer: 0,
                    explanation: "Containerization on mobile devices separates corporate data and applications from personal content using secure containers. This allows organizations to manage and secure business data without controlling the entire device."

                    answer: 0,
                    explanation: "Sandboxing isolates untrusted code or applications in a restricted environment where they can't harm the host system. This allows safe execution of potentially malicious code for analysis or limited functionality."

                    answer: 0,
                    explanation: "The primary security benefit of encryption is confidentiality - ensuring that only authorized parties can read the encrypted data. While some encryption methods also provide integrity and authentication, confidentiality is the core purpose."
